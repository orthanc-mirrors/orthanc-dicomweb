  curl http://localhost:8044/dicom-web/instances?StudyInstanceUID=1.2.3.4 shall return not only the instance tags but also the study level tags.
  See section 10.6.3.3.3 "Instance Resources" in https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/html/part18.html:
  "If the Target Resource is All Instances, then include all Study level Attributes specified in Section 10.6.3.3.1."
