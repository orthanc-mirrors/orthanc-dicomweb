* /rendered at study level shall return all instances, not only one (https://groups.google.com/g/orthanc-users/c/uFWanYhV8Fs/m/ezi1iXCXCAAJ)
  Check /rendered at series level too.

* Implement serialization of DicomWeb jobs

* Add support for application/zip in /dicom-web/studies/ (aka sup 211: https://www.dicomstandard.org/docs/librariesprovider2/dicomdocuments/news/ftsup/docs/sups/sup211.pdf?sfvrsn=9fe9edae_2)

* Based on this discussion: https://discourse.orthanc-server.org/t/series-metadata-retrieval-is-very-long-even-with-configuration-optimization/3389 
  optimize studies/.../series/.../metadata route when "SeriesMetadata" is set 
  to "MainDicomTags" and "ExtraMainDicomTags" are configured according to recommandation 
  (from this setup: https://bitbucket.org/osimis/orthanc-setup-samples/src/master/docker/stone-viewer/docker-compose.yml).
  
  with a 600 instance series with SQLite:
  - time curl http://localhost:8043/dicom-web/studies/1.2.276.0.7230010.3.1.2.1215942821.4756.1664826045.3529/series/1.2.276.0.7230010.3.1.3.1215942821.4756.1664833048.11984/metadata > /dev/null 
    -> 0.985 second because the plugin makes 600 calls to /instances/...?full 
    to retrieve all main dicom tags from the DB (but this also retrieves other 
    data like attachment info + instances metadata)
  - the content of series/.../metadata could also be obtained alternatively by 
    calling tools/find that is, in this case: 9 times faster.  However, right now, 
    it might not return the response in "Full" json format.
    time curl http://localhost:8043/tools/find --data-binary '{"Level": "Instance", "Query": {"SeriesInstanceUID": "1.2.276.0.7230010.3.1.3.1215942821.4756.1664833048.11984"}, "Expand": true}' > /dev/null 
    -> 0.178 second
  - alternate way: 
    time curl http://localhost:8043/tools/lookup --data-binary '1.2.276.0.7230010.3.1.3.1215942821.4756.1664833048.11984'
    -> 0.016 second followed by
    time curl http://localhost:8043/series/fdd31453-fa62d8cb-b681823c-f294d34c-182bca4b/instances?full > /dev/null
    -> 0.083 second
    UPDATE: we are now using this method but, the full duration to call the /metadata route is
    -> 0.335 second (only 3x faster)

  - note that all measurements have been performed on a DB with a single series !  We should repeat 
    that with a more realistic DB
