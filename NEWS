Pending changes in the mainline
===============================

=> Minimum Orthanc version: 1.12.5 <=
=> Recommended SDK version: 1.12.4 <=
=> Minimum SDK version: 1.12.1 <=

* STOW-RS: improved compatibility with, amongst others, DCM4CHEE:
  - it now accepts extra 'transfer-syntax=..' in Content-Type
  - it now returns 0008,00198 (FailedSopSequence) only if there are failed instances.
  (https://discourse.orthanc-server.org/t/orthanc-dicomweb-stowrs-server-request-response-compatibility/5763)
* If calling /rendered route on a video, the plugin will now return the video file (MP4 or ...).
  This notably enables display of videos in OHIF 3.10.1.
* Added basic support for thumbnails 
  (aka sup 203: https://www.dicomstandard.org/docs/librariesprovider2/dicomdocuments/news/progress/docs/sups/sup203.pdf).
  Right now, /thumbnail is equivalent to /rendered except for videos for 
  which the same default video icon is shown since we are not able to extract a 
  thumbnail from a video.  
  This notably enables display of a video icon in the series list of OHIF 3.10.1.
* Maintenance: Use new internal API available only from Orthanc 1.12.5 to reduce
  the number of SQL queries.
* Maintenance: Use Orthanc SDK 1.12.4 by default to benefit from more detailed logging.


Version 1.18 (2024-12-18)
=========================

=> Minimum Orthanc version: 1.11.0 <=
=> Minimum SDK version: 1.12.1 <=

* Added a "Server" entry in the DICOMweb job content
* Fixed parsing of numerical values in QIDO-RS response that prevented, among other,
  the retrieval of "NumberOfStudyRelatedInstances", "NumberOfStudyRelatedSeries",...
* Fixed non-Latin "PatientName" values that were empty in some QIDO-RS responses
* Optimized the retrieval of single frame in WADO-RS when no transcoding is required,
  which greatly improves the download time of multi-frame images in OHIF
* Optimization when running with an Orthanc that supports the "ExtendedFind" primitive
* Added support for Orthanc running in "ReadOnly" mode
* Fix handling of revisions for cached data
* Removed dependency on bootstrap-vue
* Upgraded to Bootstrap 5.3.3


Version 1.17 (2024-06-05)
=========================

* WADO-RS retrieve frame: fix issue 219 (https://orthanc.uclouvain.be/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=219)
  by converting BigEndianExplicitVR to LittleEndianExplicitVR.
* QIDO-RS: now returning sequences that are listed in includefield
  https://discourse.orthanc-server.org/t/qido-includefield-with-sequences/4746
* The plugin now uses the new logging primitives from Orthanc 1.12.4


Version 1.16 (2023-12-19)
=========================

* Removed misleading log messages about transcoding.
  https://discourse.orthanc-server.org/t/dicomweb-plugin-1-13-possible-unnecessary-transcoding/3979
* Fix parsing of Accept header "multipart/related; type=application/octet-stream; transfer-syntax=*" that is used by OHIF.
* When retrieving frames, WADO-RS may now retrieve transcoded instances from Orthanc StorageCache (for Orthanc >= 1.12.2)


Version 1.15 (2023-08-24)
=========================

* speed improvement:
  - Now storing the output of /dicom-web/studies/../series/../metadata route in an attachment that can be used
    by the "Full" mode.
    The json file is gzipped and stored in attachment 4301 everytime a series is stable or the first time
    its /dicom-web/studies/../series/../metadata route is called in "Full" mode if the attachment does not exist yet.
    A new route /studies/{orthancId}/update-dicomweb-cache has also been added to allow e.g. the Housekeeper plugin
    to generate these attachment for old studies.
    This cache can be disabled by setting "EnableMetadataCache" to false.  However, disabling the cache
    won't delete the already cached data.  You may call DELETE /series/../attachments/4031 to clear the cache.


Version 1.14 (2023-07-05)
=========================

=> Minimum SDK version: 1.12.1 <=

* speed improvements:
  - Speeded up instance metadata retrieval using OrthancPluginLoadDicomInstance() from SDK 1.12.1
  - Using multiple threads to compute the studies/../series/../metadata route when in "Full" mode.
    New configuration: "MetadataWorkerThreadsCount" defaults to 4
  - Small speed-up the studies/../series/../metadata route when in "MainDicomTags" mode.
* Support "X-Forwarded-Host" and "X-Forwarded-Proto" headers to compute BulkDataURI.
* Fix issue #216 (Requests fail due to bad parsing of the accept HTTP header (semi-colons))


Version 1.13 (2023-02-03)
=========================

* Use Orthanc SDK 1.11.3 to avoid a crash in STOW-RS jobs.


Version 1.12 (2022-10-27)
=========================

* STOW-RS now calls to the plugin flavored /instances route and now also forwards
  the HTTP headers from the Incoming STOW-RS request.


Version 1.11 (2022-10-13)
=========================

* Added a list of "Resources" in the DicomWebStowClient Job "Content"


Version 1.10 (2022-08-30)
=========================

* speed-up the /metadata routes by a factor of 2 when in "MainDicomTags" or "Extrapolate"
  mode.
* improved HTTP status code for STOW-RS (now returning 202 instead of 200 if some instances 
  could not be ingested).  Also reporting a Failure Reason "out of resources 0xA700"  if
  new instances can not be ingested because storage is full.


Version 1.9 (2022-06-30)
========================

=> Minimum SDK version: 1.9.2 <=
=> Minimum Orthanc version: 1.11.1 <=

* if using "MainDicomTags" mode for "SeriesMetadata" and "StudiesMetadata",
  the plugin now returns the "ExtraMainDicomTags" that have been configured on Orthanc side.
* Now able to return sequences stored in "ExtraMainDicomTags" (with Orthanc 1.11.1)
* refactored the way WADO-RS locate resources.  If the same SeriesInstanceUID is re-used
  across multiple Studies, the plugin should now locate it correctly.
* HTTP headers are now forwarded to "tools/find" route in Orthanc allowing user to overwrite
  the "tools/find" route in e.g. a python plugin to limit the returned results based on e.g
  an authentication token in an HTTP header.  The "tools/find" route is mainly used in QIDO-RS.
  HTTP headers are not forward to GET routes in Orthanc.  If you want to check authorization
  for these routes, it is recommended to perform it in "IncomingHttpRequestFilter" in Lua or
  with the authorization plugin.



Version 1.8 (2022-05-09)
========================

=> Minimum Orthanc version: 1.11.0 <=

* Show an error message when trying to send studies > 4GB via STOW-RS
* Optimized QIDO-RS to build its responses from DB if tags are saved in "ExtraMainDicomTags".
  Recommended configuration to optmize dicom-web usage:
    "ExtraMainDicomTags" : {
      "Instance" : [
        "Rows",
        "Columns",
        "ImageType",
        "SOPClassUID",
        "ContentDate",
        "ContentTime",
        "FrameOfReferenceUID",
        "PixelSpacing",
        "SpecificCharacterSet",
        "BitsAllocated",
        "BitsStored"
      ],
      "Series" : [
        "TimezoneOffsetFromUTC",
        "PerformedProcedureStepStartDate",
        "PerformedProcedureStepStartTime"
      ],
      "Study": [
        "TimezoneOffsetFromUTC"
      ],
      "Patient": []
    }
* New configuration "PublicRoot" that is used in RetrieveUrl tags
  and location information.  This is useful if, e.g, your Orthanc is
  behind a reverse-proxy and has another base endpoint than the "Root"
  one.  Note that, if using a reverse-proxy, make sure to set the "host"
  and "proto" correctly in the "Forwarded" HTTP headers.


Version 1.7 (2021-08-31)
========================

* Detection of windowing and rescale in ".../rendered" for Philips multiframe images


Version 1.6 (2021-05-07)
========================

========================

* Possibility to store the definition of DICOMweb servers into the Orthanc database
* New configuration option "DicomWeb.ServersInDatabase"
* Fix compliance with DICOM >= 2016c: If no "transfer-syntax" is provided in WADO-RS

Version 1.4 (2020-12-18)
========================

* "Extrapolate" mode doesn't fail if no consensus is found in WADO-RS Retrieve Metadata.
