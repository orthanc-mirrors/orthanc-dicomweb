Pending changes in the mainline
===============================

* speed-up the /metadata routes by a factor of 2 when in "MainDicomTags" or "Extrapolate"
  mode.



Version 1.9 (2022-06-30)
========================

=> Minimum SDK version: 1.9.2 <=
=> Minimum Orthanc version: 1.11.1 <=

* if using "MainDicomTags" mode for "SeriesMetadata" and "StudiesMetadata",
  the plugin now returns the "ExtraMainDicomTags" that have been configured on Orthanc side.
* Now able to return sequences stored in "ExtraMainDicomTags" (with Orthanc 1.11.1)
* refactored the way WADO-RS locate resources.  If the same SeriesInstanceUID is re-used
  across multiple Studies, the plugin should now locate it correctly.
* HTTP headers are now forwarded to "tools/find" route in Orthanc allowing user to overwrite
  the "tools/find" route in e.g. a python plugin to limit the returned results based on e.g
  an authentication token in an HTTP header.  The "tools/find" route is mainly used in QIDO-RS.
  HTTP headers are not forward to GET routes in Orthanc.  If you want to check authorization
  for these routes, it is recommended to perform it in "IncomingHttpRequestFilter" in Lua or
  with the authorization plugin.



Version 1.8 (2022-05-09)
========================

=> Minimum Orthanc version: 1.11.0 <=

* Show an error message when trying to send studies > 4GB via STOW-RS
* Optimized QIDO-RS to build its responses from DB if tags are saved in "ExtraMainDicomTags".
  Recommended configuration to optmize dicom-web usage:
    "ExtraMainDicomTags" : {
      "Instance" : [
        "Rows",
        "Columns",
        "ImageType",
        "SOPClassUID",
        "ContentDate",
        "ContentTime",
        "FrameOfReferenceUID",
        "PixelSpacing",
        "SpecificCharacterSet",
        "BitsAllocated",
        "BitsStored"
      ],
      "Series" : [
        "TimezoneOffsetFromUTC",
        "PerformedProcedureStepStartDate",
        "PerformedProcedureStepStartTime"
      ],
      "Study": [
        "TimezoneOffsetFromUTC"
      ],
      "Patient": []
    }
* New configuration "PublicRoot" that is used in RetrieveUrl tags
  and location information.  This is useful if, e.g, your Orthanc is
  behind a reverse-proxy and has another base endpoint than the "Root"
  one.  Note that, if using a reverse-proxy, make sure to set the "host"
  and "proto" correctly in the "Forwarded" HTTP headers.


Version 1.7 (2021-08-31)
========================

* Detection of windowing and rescale in ".../rendered" for Philips multiframe images

========================

Version 1.4 (2020-12-18)
========================

* "Extrapolate" mode doesn't fail if no consensus is found in WADO-RS Retrieve Metadata.
  This is necessary for proper behavior of the Stone Web viewer on very small series.

  DICOM tags + user-specified tags extrapolated from a few random instances)
